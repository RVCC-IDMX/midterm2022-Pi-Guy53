            I doubt you've heard of any of theses, but people say they are well known.
            <br>
            And these are but a taste of what I've worked with. 
            <br>

        <p>
            In my time as a web developer, I have seen things, things no one should see. Code, that should not have been written. Systems, that should never have been conceptualized. 
            I have hunted bugs bigger than your head (and if you're still reading this then you must think your site is important: big bugs indead) I've tracked these little pests through the code, erradicating them with but a few placed keystrokes.

                    A stylized rendition of one of the pages I have worked on. Its only a basic search engine, not very powerful, but people use it.

                    JavaScript code is one of the hallmarks of a responive website, efficient use of it can make the difference to a potential buyer.

                    The site I got from UsrnGamesInc was perfect. I got exactly what I needed, though what I needed was not what I initially wanted. They talked my through the process and found the perfect design for my needs.
