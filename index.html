            My name is <span class = "redacted">[You Looked]</span> and I am a web developer.
            Do <a> you </a> need a website designed that looks clean? That looks professional?
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Well, keep looking then, I am most likely over qualified for the kind of site you are trying to deploy.
        </h3>
        <p>
            In any event, here are some examples of sites I have worked on.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> Google.com </li>
            <li> Bing.com </li>
            <li> DuckDuckGo.com</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            I doubt you've heard of any of theses, but they are rather well known sites.

            And in my time as a web developer, I have seen things, things no body should see. I have hunted bugs bigger than your head (and if you're still reading this then you must think your site is important, big bugs indead) I've tracked these little pests through the code, erradicating them with a few placed strokes.
